PROYEK DATA ANALISIS E-BIKE

This final project from Dicoding's "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course focuses on analyzing a bike-sharing dataset and building a dashboard. The notebook outlines the steps I followed for Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. Additionally, I developed a dashboard using Streamlit, which can be accessed via the link in the right sidebar or here. For further details on the dataset, including its background, characteristics, and file structure, please refer to the Readme file, so I won't go into more detail [here](https://github.com/wildansibil/Wildan_Sibil/blob/main/README%20(1).md).

2.Project work cycle
    A.Data Wrangling:
        Gathering data
        Assessing data
        Cleaning data
    B.Exploratory Data Analysis:
        Defined business questions for data exploration
        Create Data exploration
    C.Data Visualization:
        Create Data Visualization that answer business questions
    D.Dashboard:
        Set up the DataFrame which will be used
        Make filter components on the dashboard
        Complete the dashboard with various data visualizations
Note: Numbers 1 to 3 are in the dicoding-collection-exercise and number 4 is in dashboard.

3. Getting Started Proyek_Analisis_Data_Wildan_Sibil_Danillah_Safri.ipynb
4. Download this project.
5. Open your favorite IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory (but in here I am using Google Colab).
6. Create a New Notebook.
7. Upload and select the file with .ipynb extension.
8. Connect to hosted runtime.
9. Lastly, run the code cells.

Streamlir run
Bangkit_Dashboard/dashboard.py

1. Download this project.
2. Install the Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt using pip install streamlit. Install another libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and          seaborn if you haven't.
3. Please note, don't move the csv file because it acts a data source. keep it in one folder as dashboard.py
4. Open your VSCode and run the file by clicking the terminal and write it streamlit run dashboard.py.
